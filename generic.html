								<p>I am a government-funded international student in Japan, currently studying at Tokyo Institute of Technology, in Ookayama. I hail from Brazil, however, as part of my 5-year scholarship, I have moved to Japan in 2019 and lived there ever since. For one year, I studied Japanese in the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies (TUFS), and after that first year of preparation, I enrolled at Tokyo Tech as an undergraduate student.</p>
								<p>Among my interests, I would say Literature, Technology, Management, Design, and Samba stand out. While still living in Brazil, I used to study literature written in English and Portuguese, my native language, and also teach English to people of all ages in schools and English courses. Since I came to Japan, I still occasionally work in events related to teaching English in High Schools around the Kanto area. Another hobbie I brought from Brazil to Japan is my passion for Samba and Pagode, two music genres that originate from the place where I was born. Here in Tokyo, I participate in some Samba groups and also perform on the annual Carnival of Asakusa with a Samba school, which is how we usually call Samba associations.</p>
								<p>Regarding my interest for technology and design, I believe a few examples of those can be found in this website, so please, do take a look!</p>
