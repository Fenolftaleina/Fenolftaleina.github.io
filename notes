<h2><a href="#">Tokyo Tech Student Survey book<br /></a></h2>
									<p>One of my activities in college is to conduct surveys with all the current students in college, and, based on their opinions, create a book of proposals for changes for the university's future. I was also the art-director for the book in 2021.<br /></p>
